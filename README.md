# The Odin Project - Web Development

## Project: Library

A simple library web application. Users can add or remove books from the library, change the read status of a book, and sort books through various options, or clear the library. Users can also search for books using the search bar which will check for any book whose title, author, tags, or pages matches the input. There are some starter books provided as examples. I've added some responsiveness to the app and while I'm mostly happy with where it's at, I plan to improve it over the next few days.
